apakah ada cara untuk mengimplementasikannya menjadi sebuah Resful api dimana akan ada api untuk upload pdf, isi pdf di ekstrak dengan langchain, lalu untuk model seperti fasttext dan yang lainnya di simpan dalam database, untuk databasenya bebas namun jika tidak bisa memakai database tolong sarankan saya bagaimana saya mengelola pdf dan modelnya , nantinya user yang ingin mendapatkan context dari pertanyaan akan mengirim body pdf yang di tanyakan, pertanyaan, dan model yang ingin di pakai untuk mencari contextnya
### BLACKBOX.AI

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to convert their existing RAG code into a RESTful API. The main requirements are:

1. API endpoints for uploading PDFs, extracting text using LangChain.
2. Storing the extracted text and trained models (like FastText) in a database.
3. Allowing users to query by sending the PDF, a question, and choosing the model to get context.

First, I need to figure out the architecture. The user mentioned using any database, but if that's not feasible, suggest alternatives. Since models can be large, storing them in a database might not be efficient. Maybe using the filesystem and storing paths in the database would be better.

For the PDF processing, LangChain has a PyPDFLoader. So the plan is: when a user uploads a PDF, the backend uses LangChain to extract text, preprocesses it, and stores it. Then, when a query comes in, the system retrieves the relevant context from the stored documents using the selected embedding model.

Storing models: Training a model each time a PDF is uploaded isn't practical. Maybe pre-train the models (Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe) on a corpus and use them for inference. Alternatively, if the user wants to train on the uploaded documents, we need a way to save and load models. But training on each upload could be resource-heavy. Perhaps using pre-trained models and updating them incrementally? But that's complex. Maybe for simplicity, use pre-trained models like GloVe and not retrain on user documents. Or, if retraining is needed, save the model files to disk and reference them via the database.

Database choice: For storing documents and model metadata, a relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite could work. Each PDF upload creates a record with its extracted text, and each model's metadata (type, path to model file, etc.) is stored.

API endpoints needed:
- POST /upload: Accept PDF, process, store text.
- POST /query: Accept PDF, question, model type; return context.

Wait, but the user wants to send the PDF in the query request. That might not be efficient. Maybe the workflow is: upload PDFs first via /upload, get a document ID, then query with that ID. But the user's question mentions sending the PDF in the query body. That could be problematic for large files. Maybe the initial step is to upload the PDF, store it, and then when querying, reference the stored PDF by ID. But the user's example seems to want the PDF sent along with the query. That might require handling PDF processing on each query, which is not efficient. Need to clarify, but proceed as per the user's description.

So, the steps are:

1. User uploads a PDF via API.
2. Server extracts text, preprocesses, stores in DB.
3. When querying, user sends the PDF (maybe by ID), question, and model type.
4. Server uses the stored text from that PDF, retrieves the relevant context using the selected model, and generates an answer via ChatGPT.

But storing the PDF's text in the database is essential. So the database will have a table for documents, each with an ID, original PDF path, extracted text, and preprocessing.

For the models, perhaps have a models table that stores the type (Word2Vec, FastText, GloVe) and the path to the model file. But GloVe is static, while Word2Vec and FastText can be trained on the uploaded documents. However, training a model per PDF isn't practical. Maybe the models are pre-trained on a large corpus and used as is. Alternatively, if the user wants to train on their uploaded documents, the system would need to retrain the model each time a new document is added, which is not feasible for a scalable API. So perhaps the models are pre-trained, and the uploaded documents are used to create embeddings on the fly.

Wait, in the original code, the models are trained on the provided documents. So in the API, when a user uploads a PDF, the text is added to the documents list, and the models are retrained. But retraining models every time a new document is added is computationally expensive. That's a problem for an API expecting multiple users and documents.

Alternative approach: Use the uploaded documents to build a corpus, and when querying, use a pre-trained embedding model (like Sentence Transformers) to encode the documents and the query, then compute similarity. This would be more efficient than training custom Word2Vec/FastText models each time. But the user's existing code uses Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe. Maybe the user wants to stick with those.

Alternatively, for each uploaded PDF, generate document embeddings using a pre-trained model and store those embeddings in the database. Then, when a query comes in, compute the query embedding and find the closest document embeddings. This avoids retraining models and is more scalable.

But the user's current setup trains Word2Vec/FastText on the documents. If the API is supposed to allow users to upload their own PDFs and use those for context, then each user's data is separate. So perhaps each user has their own set of documents and models. But that complicates the database design.

Assuming the scope is a single user or all documents are public, the steps would be:

- When a PDF is uploaded, extract text, add to the documents list.
- The embedding models (Word2Vec, FastText) are retrained on all documents, including the new one.
- Store the models periodically or after each update.

But retraining models on every upload is not feasible for a production API. It's too slow and resource-heavy. So perhaps the solution is to use pre-trained models for embeddings, like SBERT (Sentence-BERT), which can generate embeddings without retraining. But the user's code uses Word2Vec, etc. Maybe the user wants to keep using those, so need to find a way to handle model storage.

Alternatively, when a PDF is uploaded, process it into tokens, and for each token, store its embedding using GloVe (which is static). For Word2Vec and FastText, which are trained on the corpus, the models need to be retrained each time a new document is added. This is not practical unless the system batches uploads and retrains periodically.

Given the constraints, perhaps the best approach is:

- Use pre-trained GloVe embeddings for the RAG, as they don't require retraining.
- For Word2Vec and FastText, pre-train them on a large corpus and use them as static models, not retraining on user-uploaded documents. But that would limit the model's relevance to the specific documents.
- Alternatively, for each user, maintain a separate model that's trained on their documents. But storing and managing multiple models is challenging.

Given the complexity, maybe the answer should suggest using a pre-trained model like Sentence Transformers for embeddings, which doesn't require training on the user's data and can handle any text. But the user's existing code uses Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe. So perhaps the answer should outline both options.

Now, structuring the RESTful API:

Endpoints:
1. POST /api/upload: Accept a PDF file, extract text, store in database.
2. POST /api/query: Accept a query, model type, and possibly PDF ID (if multiple PDFs are stored), return context and answer.

But the user wants the query to include the PDF, question, and model. That implies that each query is self-contained with the PDF. This is not efficient for multiple queries on the same PDF, but perhaps for the scope, it's acceptable.

So, the flow would be:

- User sends a POST to /api/query with a PDF file, the question, and model type.
- The server extracts text from the PDF, preprocesses it.
- Generates embeddings using the selected model.
- Finds the relevant context.
- Queries ChatGPT with the context and question.
- Returns the answer.

But this processes the PDF on every query, which is redundant if the same PDF is queried multiple times. However, for simplicity, maybe that's acceptable for a small-scale API.

Alternatively, the user uploads the PDF once via /api/upload, gets a document ID, and then queries using that ID. This is more efficient but requires managing document storage.

Assuming the user wants the PDF included in each query (for simplicity in the example), the steps are:

1. In the query endpoint, extract the PDF, process it into documents.
2. Train the embedding model on these documents (but this is time-consuming).
3. Perform the context retrieval and answer generation.

But training a model on the fly for each query is not feasible. Therefore, the initial approach of using a pre-trained model that doesn't require training on the user's data is better.

Wait, the user's existing code has a list of documents that are used to train the Word2Vec and FastText models. So in the API, when a user uploads a PDF, those sentences are added to the documents list, and the models are retrained. But that's not practical for an API. So perhaps the solution is to use the pre-trained GloVe model, which doesn't require retraining, and for each PDF, extract the text, preprocess it, and store the tokens. Then, when querying, compute the average GloVe embedding for the query and each document, and find similarities.

This approach skips the need to train Word2Vec/FastText on the user's data, using GloVe instead. That would make the API more responsive.

So, modifying the original code to use GloVe for embeddings, and when a PDF is uploaded, its text is extracted, processed, and stored. The GloVe embeddings are static, so no model training is needed. The find_context function would use GloVe vectors.

In that case, the API would:

- Use LangChain to extract text from PDF.
- Preprocess the text into tokens.
- Store the tokens in the database (maybe along with the original text).
- When querying, compute the average GloVe vector for the query and each document, then find the most similar documents.

This avoids model training and is scalable.

But the user's code includes Word2Vec and FastText models trained on the documents. If the user wants to keep using those, the API would need to retrain the models each time a new document is added. That's not feasible for a RESTful API with multiple users or frequent uploads.

Therefore, the answer should suggest using pre-trained models (like GloVe or Sentence Transformers) for efficiency and scalability. Then, the steps are:

1. User uploads PDF via API.
2. Server extracts text, preprocesses, stores in DB.
3. When querying, user sends the PDF (or its ID), question, and model type (GloVe, etc.).
4. Server retrieves the stored text, computes embeddings using the selected model, finds context, and generates an answer.

But how to handle the model storage? For GloVe, it's a static file. For Sentence Transformers, the model is downloaded once and cached. For Word2Vec/FastText, if they are pre-trained on a large corpus, the model files can be stored on the server, and the API loads them as needed.

So, the database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) would store:

- Documents: ID, original text, processed tokens, etc.
- Model metadata: model type, path to model file, etc.

But the actual model files (Word2Vec, FastText binaries) are stored on the filesystem, and the database references their paths.

Implementing this, the API would have endpoints for upload and query. The upload endpoint processes the PDF and stores the text. The query endpoint uses the selected model to compute embeddings and retrieve context.

For the code structure:

- Use FastAPI or Flask to create the API.
- Use LangChain's PyPDFLoader to extract text from PDF.
- Store documents in a database (e.g., SQLite with SQLAlchemy).
- For models, have a utility to load them (GloVe from file, Word2Vec/FastText from pretrained models).
- The query processing uses the selected model to get embeddings and compute similarity.

Potential code outline:

1. Setup FastAPI app and database models.
2. PDF processing route.
3. Query handling route.
4. Utility functions for embeddings and similarity.

Now, considering the user's request to include LangChain for PDF extraction, the code would need to integrate that. Also, handling different embedding models based on user choice.

In summary, the steps are:

- Create a RESTful API using FastAPI.
- Use LangChain to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
- Store extracted texts in a database.
- For embeddings, use pre-trained models (GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText) stored on the server.
- When querying, retrieve the relevant documents using the selected model and return the ChatGPT-generated answer.

Possible challenges:

- Handling large PDFs and processing time.
- Model loading and caching for efficient inference.
- Database management for storing documents and their embeddings.

The final answer should outline the API structure, database schema, and provide example code using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and LangChain, while suggesting using pre-trained models to avoid retraining on each upload.

    model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    return model

def semantic_search(query, documents, model, top_k=5):
    doc_embeddings = model.encode(documents)
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, doc_embeddings)[0]
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
    return [documents[i] for i in top_indices]
```

5. **Deployment**:
- Gunakan Uvicorn untuk menjalankan server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

6. **Rekomendasi Penyimpanan**:
- **Untuk PDF/Dokumen**:
  - Gunakan cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
  - Simpan path/refer

jika saya ingin menggunakan cloudinary untuk menyimpan file pdf tersebut bagaiamana saya melakukannya dan bagian kode mana saja yang harus saya rubah?
### BLACKBOX.AI

<think>
Okay, the user wants to integrate Cloudinary into their existing RAG API setup to store PDF files. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall how Cloudinary works. Cloudinary is a cloud service for managing images and files. They provide an SDK for Python, so I should suggest installing that. The user will need to set up their Cloudinary account and get the API credentials: cloud name, API key, and API secret.

Next, the original code uses temporary files to process uploaded PDFs. With Cloudinary, instead of saving the file locally, the PDF should be uploaded directly to Cloudinary. So, in the upload endpoint, after receiving the file, the code should upload it to Cloudinary and store the returned URL in the database. That way, the actual file isn't stored on the server, just the reference.

I need to modify the database model. The Document table currently has fields for original_text and processed_text. Now, adding a field like cloudinary_url makes sense to store the PDF's URL from Cloudinary. Also, maybe a public_id field to reference the file in Cloudinary for future operations.

Then, in the upload_pdf function, instead of using a temporary file, the code should read the file content, upload it to Cloudinary using the upload method, and then save the URL and public_id to the database. The LangChain processing can still be done by using the in-memory content, so there's no need to save the file locally. That way, the temporary file step is eliminated, which is more efficient and secure.

For the query part, if the user needs to access the original PDF later, the URL from Cloudinary can be used. But since the text is already extracted and stored in the database, maybe the PDF storage is just for backup or reference. So the main changes are in the upload process.

Also, error handling is important. The user should handle cases where the Cloudinary upload fails, perhaps raising an HTTP exception with an appropriate message. Additionally, configuring the Cloudinary SDK with the credentials from environment variables is necessary for security.

What about the existing code that deletes the temporary file? Since we're not saving the file anymore, that part can be removed. Instead, after uploading to Cloudinary, the file content is processed directly from memory.

Testing the code would involve ensuring that the PDF is correctly uploaded to Cloudinary, the URL is stored, and the text extraction works as before. Also, checking that the public_id is correctly stored for possible future management of the Cloudinary assets.

In summary, the key changes are: adding Cloudinary configuration, modifying the upload endpoint to upload the PDF to Cloudinary, updating the database schema to include Cloudinary URLs, and adjusting the text processing to work with in-memory data instead of temporary files.

Berikut modifikasi yang perlu dilakukan untuk mengintegrasikan Cloudinary sebagai penyimpanan PDF:

1. **Instal Library Cloudinary**:
```bash
pip install cloudinary
```

2. **Tambahkan Konfigurasi Cloudinary** di awal kode:
```python
import cloudinary
import cloudinary.uploader

cloudinary.config(
    cloud_name = 'your_cloud_name',
    api_key = 'your_api_key',
    api_secret = 'your_api_secret'
)
```

3. **Modifikasi Model Database**:
```python
class Document(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'documents'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    filename = Column(String)
    cloudinary_url = Column(String)  # URL Cloudinary
    public_id = Column(String)       # Public ID Cloudinary
    original_text = Column(Text)
    processed_text = Column(Text)
    embeddings_model_type = Column(String)
    embeddings_path = Column(String)
```

4. **Modifikasi Endpoint Upload**:
```python
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        # Upload ke Cloudinary
        upload_result = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
            file.file,
            resource_type = "auto",
            folder = "rag-documents",
            format = "pdf"
        )
        
        # Process PDF dari URL Cloudinary
        pdf_url = upload_result['secure_url']
        loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_url)
        pages = loader.load_and_split()
        
        # Process text
        texts = [p.page_content for p in pages]
        processed_texts = [preprocess_text(t) for t in texts]
        
        # Save to database
        with Session(engine) as session:
            doc = Document(
                filename=file.filename,
                cloudinary_url=pdf_url,
                public_id=upload_result['public_id'],
                original_text="\n".join(texts),
                processed_text="\n".join([" ".join(t) for t in processed_texts])
            )
            session.add(doc)
            session.commit()
        
        return {"message": "File processed successfully", 
                "document_id": doc.id,
                "cloudinary_url": pdf_url}
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

5. **Tambahkan Endpoint untuk Hapus Dokumen**:
```python
@app.delete("/documents/{document_id}")
async def delete_document(document_id: int):
    try:
        with Session(engine) as session:
            doc = session.get(Document, document_id)
            if not doc:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Document not found")
            
            # Hapus dari Cloudinary
            cloudinary.uploader.destroy(doc.public_id)
            
            # Hapus dari database
            session.delete(doc)
            session.commit()
            
            return {"message": "Document deleted successfully"}
    
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

6. **Modifikasi Process PDF**:
```python
def process_pdf(cloudinary_url: str):
    loader = PyPDFLoader(cloudinary_url)
    pages = loader.load_and_split()
    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
    texts = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)
    return [t.page_content for t in texts]
```

Perubahan utama yang dilakukan:
1. **Mengganti penyimpanan lokal dengan Cloudinary**:
   - File PDF langsung diupload ke Cloudinary tanpa disimpan ke filesystem lokal
   - Menggunakan URL Cloudinary untuk mengakses PDF saat processing

2. **Database Schema**:
   - Menambahkan field `cloudinary_url` dan `public_id` untuk menyimpan referensi ke Cloudinary

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Menambahkan error handling khusus untuk operasi Cloudinary
   - Menghapus file dari Cloudinary saat dokumen dihapus

4. **Security**:
   - Menggunakan `secure_url` untuk akses HTTPS
   - Menyimpan public_id untuk manajemen aset di Cloudinary

Untuk implementasi ini, Anda perlu:
1. Daftar akun Cloudinary gratis di [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
